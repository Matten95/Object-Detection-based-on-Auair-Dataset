# Object-Detection-based-on-Auair-Dataset
The original code of this project refers to https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3.
However, the dataset is quite different, the dataset of this project is https://bozcani.github.io/auairdataset。
We modified the size of anchor box according to the change of different images and objects in the dataset。
